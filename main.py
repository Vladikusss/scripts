 /*
 * Created by Vladdy | 27.02.2025
 * Last Updated: 27.02.2025
 * Program: Recipe script to search and output information on meals.
 * Version: 1.0
 * Status: In progress
 * Detailed description:
---> Search and output information about meal recipes for specific time of the day,
e.g. morning, day, dinner.
---> Search and output information about meals based on the ingredients available.
---> Output if meals searched have any allergens, and if so which ones.
---> The user can then choose the meal from the list searched, and the program will output the information about the meal.

 *** Own Reference: Fix the loop in the class, add _str_ to the Meal class, fix any other issues
